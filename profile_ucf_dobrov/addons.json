When DownloadHelper detects embedded videos it can access for download, the toolbar icon highlights and a simple menu allows you to download files by simply clicking an item.\n\nFor instance, if you go to a YouTube page, you'll be able to download the video directly on your file system. It also works with most other popular video sites like DailyMotion, Facebook, Periscope, Vimeo, Twitch, Liveleak, Vine, UStream, Fox, Bloomberg, RAI, France 2-3, Break, Metacafe, and thousands of others.\n\nVideo DownloadHelper supports several types of streamings, making the add-on unique amongst Video downloaders: HTTP, HLS, DASH, … Whenever a site uses a non-supported streaming technology, Video DownloadHelper is able to capture the media directly from the screen and generate a video file.\n\nBesides downloading, Video DownloadHelper is also capable of making file conversions (i.e. change audio and video formats) and aggregation (combining separate audio and video into a single file). This is an upgrade feature that helps pay for the free stuff (we need to eat too). You are not compelled to use conversion for downloading videos from websites, and you can avoid picking variants marked as ADP to avoid the need for aggregation.\n\nVideo overview on how to use Video DownloadHelper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZT8yI60k_4\n\nSupport can be obtained from the dedicated support forum.\n\nPlease stay tuned by following us on Twitter (@downloadhelper), or Facebook.","weeklyDownloads":57337,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"mig","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/32479/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/25/25993.png?modified=1622132280","width":200,"height":150,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/25/25993.jpg?modified=1622132280","thumbnailWidth":200,"thumbnailHeight":150,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154820.png?modified=1622132280","width":327,"height":124,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154820.jpg?modified=1622132280","thumbnailWidth":327,"thumbnailHeight":124,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper animated toobar icon"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154824.png?modified=1622132280","width":250,"height":200,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154824.jpg?modified=1622132280","thumbnailWidth":250,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154822.png?modified=1622132280","width":361,"height":289,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154822.jpg?modified=1622132280","thumbnailWidth":361,"thumbnailHeight":289,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154826.png?modified=1622132281","width":320,"height":317,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154826.jpg?modified=1622132281","thumbnailWidth":320,"thumbnailHeight":317,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper available actions"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154828.png?modified=1622132281","width":293,"height":250,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154828.jpg?modified=1622132281","thumbnailWidth":293,"thumbnailHeight":250,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper quality variants settings"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.2837,"reviewCount":12708,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/reviews/","updateDate":1630939550000},{"id":"{2495d258-41e7-4cd5-bc7d-ac15981f064e}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/994/994899-32.png?modified=083a7848","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/994/994899-64.png?modified=083a7848","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/994/994899-128.png?modified=083a7848"},"name":"Readability based Reader View","version":"0.5.3","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3915202/readability_based_reader_view-0.5.3-fx.xpi","homepageURL":"http://add0n.com/chrome-reader-view.html","supportURL":"https://add0n.com/chrome-reader-view.html","description":"strips away clutter like buttons, background images, and changes the page's text size, contrast and layout for better readability.
